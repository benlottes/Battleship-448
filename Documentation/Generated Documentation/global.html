<div class="description">
    endGame() takes winner to display the winner of the game. When endGame() is called it first disables any further click events to register. After that, restoreShips() is called on the current player’s turnso each player can see the opponents ship placements. Next, both the start-game and end-game buttons aredisables to prevent further blacking out of the screen. Finally, a window alert is called to display the winner of the game for both players to see.

    hideShips takes in current player turn as a parameter then checks if player one or player two is currently up. If it is player-one’s turn then player-two’s ships must be hidden for the incoming shot made by player one. So, hideShips checks each cell to see of player-two's board for any grey colored cells. If a cell is grey, or a cell with a ship object, then it will be set to transparent to effectively hide the ships while maintaining the hits and misses. If the current player's turn is equal to 2 it will hide player-one's ships.

<div class="description">
    startGame takes in the user input shipCount to initialize the number of ships that will need to be placed by each player. Next, startGame() disables both the start turn and end turn buttons to avoid a turn switch before all ships have been placed by the player. After that, the click event is called and if current turn is 1, then player one can click a cell to choose a head location of the first ship. If the placement is valid then a new ship object is created to be inserted into the cell. After the cell detects a ship object it is colored gray. If the ship object is greater than length 1, then the user will be prompted to click any of the possible tail locations to orient the ship. A check is put in place that disallows the user to click any other cells until a viable tail is selected. After a head and tail location are selected the entire space between them is colored gray to indicate the location of the player's ship. If there are no more ships to be placed by player one, then end turn can be pressed and the next player can begin the same process of placing ships. After all ships by both players are placed, player-one's shooting phase begins and a shotRow and shotColum on player-two’s board can be selected by player one. attemptedShot() is called and if shotRow and shotColumn have a ship object stored in that location then a hit is declared, and the cell is colored red. If a hit is declared, then allSunk() is called to check if the player has sunk all the opponent's ships and won the game. If no winner is decided yet, then the next player begins the same process of clicking on a shotRow and shotColumn.  If there is no ship object in that location then the shot is declared as a miss and the cell is colored blue.
